### **SQLite Best Practices for Development**

---

**David (Mentor):** Hey James, today I want to talk about some best practices for using SQLite in development. It’s a great database, but there are a few things you should keep in mind to make sure your projects are efficient and maintainable. Sound good?

**James (Student):** Absolutely! I’ve been using SQLite, but I feel like I might be missing out on some tips to make my work better. What are some of the key practices?

**David:** Well, SQLite is a fantastic embedded database, but because it’s lightweight and doesn’t have a server, there are certain practices that can help you avoid common pitfalls. Let’s break it down.

---

### **1. Use Transactions for Multiple Changes**

**James:** So, what’s the first thing I should focus on?

**David:** The first best practice is using **transactions** whenever you're making multiple changes to the database. Transactions ensure that your database stays consistent even if there’s a crash or error.

Let’s say you’re inserting data into three tables. If one insert fails, the others shouldn’t go through. Wrap your operations in a transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 30);
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (1, 100);
INSERT INTO payments (order_id, amount) VALUES (1, 100);

COMMIT;
```

**James:** So, if something goes wrong during one of those operations, nothing will be inserted, and I won’t have partial data, right?

**David:** Exactly! Without a transaction, you’d end up with partial updates, which could cause data corruption or inconsistencies.

---

### **2. Keep Your Database Small and Efficient**

**James:** That makes sense. What’s the next best practice?

**David:** Another key point is to **keep your database small** and avoid bloating it with unnecessary data. SQLite works best with small databases, and the larger your database grows, the slower it can get.

Here’s a quick tip: If you have large amounts of data, consider **splitting your data into multiple databases**. For example, you might have one database for user data and another for logs.

You can also periodically **vacuum** the database to reclaim unused space:

```sql
VACUUM;
```

**James:** So, if I delete a lot of rows or update them, SQLite doesn’t automatically clean up the empty space?

**David:** Exactly! The `VACUUM` command rebuilds the entire database and cleans up unused space, improving performance.

---

### **3. Use Proper Indexing**

**James:** What about indexing? I know indexes speed up searches, but is there a right way to use them?

**David:** Great question! Indexing is super important, but too many indexes can actually slow down your database, especially when it comes to **write operations** like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. Here’s the thing: only index columns that you actually query often.

For example, if you’re frequently searching for users by email, you should create an index on the `email` column:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

**James:** So, indexes are like shortcuts to get faster results, but too many of them can slow down performance, right?

**David:** Exactly! So, try to strike a balance. Index only the columns that are frequently searched or involved in joins.

---

### **4. Avoid Using `LIKE` for Large Text Searches**

**James:** I’ve used the `LIKE` operator for text searches in the past. Is that not a good idea?

**David:** It’s okay for small datasets, but as your database grows, `LIKE` can become slow—especially when you use it with wildcards. Instead, consider using **Full-Text Search (FTS)** if you need to search through large text fields.

For example, if you're searching through articles or blog posts, using FTS can be much faster:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE articles USING fts4(title, content);
```

Then, you can search like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE content MATCH 'SQLite';
```

**James:** So, `LIKE` is okay for smaller queries, but for large text data, FTS is way faster?

**David:** Exactly! FTS is specifically designed for searching large text fields, so it’s the better choice when working with a lot of text.

---

### **5. Optimize Your Queries and Avoid Unnecessary Joins**

**James:** Any tips on making my queries faster?

**David:** Absolutely. One thing to keep in mind is to **avoid unnecessary joins**. Sometimes you can optimize a query by **denormalizing** your data or using simpler queries.

For instance, instead of joining multiple tables in a single query, consider storing frequently accessed data together in a single table. Of course, this depends on your use case, but it’s something to think about.

Also, always check your **query execution plans** using the `EXPLAIN` statement to see how SQLite is executing your queries. This can help you identify slow spots in your queries and optimize them.

---

### **Pitfalls to Watch Out For**

**James:** These tips are really helpful. But what should I avoid when using SQLite?

**David:** Great question! Here are a few pitfalls:

1. **Ignoring Transactions**: Not using transactions, especially for bulk inserts, can lead to inconsistent or partial data.
   
2. **Overuse of Indexes**: Too many indexes can hurt performance, especially when inserting or updating data.

3. **Not Using Proper Data Types**: SQLite is pretty flexible with data types, but it’s best to be explicit. For example, use `INTEGER` for integers and `TEXT` for strings, instead of using `BLOB` or `REAL` for everything.

4. **Database Locking**: SQLite can be slow when multiple processes or threads are trying to write to the database simultaneously. Be mindful of how you manage database access if your app is multi-threaded or multi-process.

---

### **Highlights of SQLite Best Practices**

**David:** To recap, here’s what you should remember:

- **Use transactions** to keep your data consistent.
- **Keep the database small** by cleaning up unused space and splitting data when needed.
- **Index properly**: Only index the columns that are frequently searched.
- **Use FTS for large text searches** instead of `LIKE`.
- **Avoid unnecessary joins** and use the `EXPLAIN` statement to analyze your queries.

---

### **Exercises to Try**

1. **Exercise 1**: Set up a small database with a `users` table. Use transactions to insert multiple users in one go and ensure data integrity.
   
2. **Exercise 2**: Create an index on a frequently queried column and test the performance difference when searching with and without the index.

3. **Exercise 3**: Create a table with a large `text` column and implement FTS for searching that column efficiently.

4. **Exercise 4**: Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to analyze a complex query and optimize it.
