### **Speech: Deleting Rows Safely with DELETE**

---

**James:** XiaoMing, I’ve been cleaning up my database and realized some rows aren’t needed anymore. How can I get rid of them?

**XiaoMing:** That’s where the `DELETE` statement comes in handy. It allows you to remove rows from a table—but only the ones you want, if you’re careful.

**James:** Hmm, “if you’re careful” sounds ominous.

**XiaoMing:** (laughs) It’s just about avoiding mistakes. Let me explain.

---

### **How DELETE Works**

**XiaoMing:** The basic syntax looks like this:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

**James:** And if I forget the `WHERE` clause?

**XiaoMing:** You’ll delete **all rows** in the table. That’s why being cautious is crucial.

---

### **Example 1: Deleting Specific Rows**

**XiaoMing:** Let’s say you have a `users` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    active INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO users (id, name, active)
VALUES (1, 'Alice', 1), (2, 'Bob', 0), (3, 'Charlie', 0);
```

Now, you want to delete users who are inactive:

```sql
DELETE FROM users
WHERE active = 0;
```

**James:** That would remove Bob and Charlie, right?

**XiaoMing:** Exactly!

---

### **Example 2: Deleting All Rows**

**XiaoMing:** If you ever need to delete all rows, you can do this:

```sql
DELETE FROM users;
```

**James:** But doesn’t that leave the table structure intact?

**XiaoMing:** Yes, it only removes the data, not the table itself.

---

### **Pitfalls**

**XiaoMing:** Here are a few common pitfalls:
1. **Forgetting the WHERE Clause:** This leads to unintentional deletion of all rows.
2. **Miswriting the Condition:** Double-check your `WHERE` clause to avoid deleting the wrong rows.
3. **Ignoring Transactions:** If your database supports them, always use transactions for critical deletions.

**James:** So, I can roll back if something goes wrong?

**XiaoMing:** Exactly!

---

### **Highlights**

- The `DELETE` statement removes rows from a table.
- Always use a `WHERE` clause to avoid accidental deletions.
- For critical operations, wrap your `DELETE` query in a transaction.

---

### **Exercises**

1. **Delete Specific Rows:** Write a query to delete a user from the `users` table whose `id` is 1.
2. **Delete with Multiple Conditions:** Remove all users whose `name` starts with 'A' or who are inactive.
3. **Test Without WHERE Clause:** Experiment with `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause on a sample table and observe the result.
