### **SQLite Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them**

---

**David (Mentor):** Hey James, today we’re going to dive into **common pitfalls** that developers run into when using SQLite and how to avoid them. SQLite is great for lightweight applications, but like any tool, if you're not careful, you can run into some issues. Are you ready?

**James (Student):** I’m all ears! I know SQLite is pretty flexible, but I’m guessing there are some common traps to watch out for.

**David:** You’re right! Let’s walk through some of those pitfalls and how you can sidestep them.

---

### **1. Ignoring Transactions**

**James:** I’ve used SQLite for small apps, but I never really thought about transactions. Are they that important?

**David:** Definitely. A huge pitfall is **not using transactions** when doing multiple inserts, updates, or deletes. If you don’t use transactions, you risk leaving your database in an inconsistent state if something goes wrong.

For example, let’s say you’re inserting data into multiple tables:

```sql
-- Without transaction
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (1, 50);
```

If the second query fails, you’ll end up with data in `users` but not in `orders`, which is bad. Here’s how you can use a transaction to fix that:

```sql
-- With transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice');
INSERT INTO orders (user_id, total) VALUES (1, 50);

COMMIT;
```

**James:** So, if one of the queries fails, it’ll roll everything back to the start, right?

**David:** Exactly! Transactions make sure that either everything succeeds, or nothing does. It's all-or-nothing.

---

### **2. Overusing `LIKE` for Search**

**James:** I’ve used `LIKE` a lot for searching through text fields. Is that a problem?

**David:** Yes, especially with larger datasets. The **`LIKE`** operator can be slow, especially when used with wildcards like `%` at the beginning of the string. Let’s say you’re searching for articles that contain the word "SQLite":

```sql
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE content LIKE '%SQLite%';
```

This query can be very slow if the dataset is large, because SQLite needs to scan every row.

Instead, use **Full-Text Search (FTS)**, which is designed for searching large text fields efficiently:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE articles USING fts4(content);
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE content MATCH 'SQLite';
```

**James:** So, FTS is way faster for large text searches?

**David:** Exactly. It’s optimized for searching through large amounts of text, while `LIKE` is better suited for smaller datasets.

---

### **3. Not Using Proper Data Types**

**James:** SQLite is pretty flexible with data types, right? Can that flexibility cause problems?

**David:** Absolutely! One common mistake is not being careful about **data types**. SQLite doesn’t enforce strict data types, which can lead to confusion or bugs down the road. For example, if you store dates as strings or store integers as text, it could lead to unexpected behavior.

For instance, let’s say you insert a date as a string:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (event_date TEXT);
INSERT INTO events (event_date) VALUES ('2025-01-01');
```

If you try to query dates in a logical order, it may not work as expected because the string format is alphabetic, not chronological. To avoid this, use **INTEGER** for timestamps or proper date handling:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (event_date INTEGER);
INSERT INTO events (event_date) VALUES (strftime('%s', '2025-01-01'));
```

**James:** So, always be mindful of the types I’m using, even though SQLite is flexible with them?

**David:** Exactly! Stick to the correct types to avoid confusion, especially when working with dates, times, and numbers.

### **4. Overuse of Indexes**

**James:** Indexes are great for speeding up queries, right? So, should I index everything?

**David:** Not exactly. **Over-indexing** is a common pitfall. While indexes make queries faster, they slow down **write operations** like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`. If you have too many indexes, it could hurt your database performance.

For example, if you create indexes on every column just to "speed things up", your writes will get slower over time. Only index columns that you frequently query. Here’s a good example:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

**James:** So, only index columns I frequently search or join by, right?

**David:** That’s right! Keep it efficient. Don’t overdo it with indexes.

### **5. SQLite’s Locking Mechanism in Multi-Threaded Apps**

**James:** What about SQLite’s performance in multi-threaded applications? Is that a potential issue?

**David:** Definitely. SQLite uses **database-level locking**. This means if one thread or process is writing to the database, other threads are locked out. In multi-threaded or multi-process applications, this can become a bottleneck.

To avoid this, you can use **serialized mode** or manage database access carefully to make sure one thread writes at a time. Here's a quick example of how to set the **PRAGMA journal_mode** to WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) to improve concurrency:

```sql
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
```

**James:** So, WAL mode allows for better concurrency because readers don’t block writers, right?

**David:** Exactly. But just be aware of SQLite’s limitations if you're working with a highly concurrent system.

---

### **Pitfalls Recap**

**David:** Let’s quickly summarize the common pitfalls:

- **Ignoring transactions**: Always wrap multiple operations in a transaction to ensure consistency.
- **Overusing `LIKE`**: For large text searches, use **FTS** instead of `LIKE`.
- **Not using proper data types**: Be mindful of your data types to avoid confusion.
- **Over-indexing**: Only index columns that are frequently queried or involved in joins.
- **SQLite locking**: Understand how SQLite’s locking mechanism works and avoid heavy multi-threading issues.

### **Exercises to Try**

1. **Exercise 1**: Implement a basic transaction for inserting multiple records and test what happens when one of the inserts fails.
2. **Exercise 2**: Try using `LIKE` on a large dataset and compare the performance with FTS-based search.
3. **Exercise 3**: Create a table with a mix of different data types (TEXT, INTEGER, BLOB), and see how SQLite handles them in practice.
4. **Exercise 4**: Test the performance of a query with too many indexes and compare it with a well-indexed table.
